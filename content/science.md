# Did scientists publish ciphers and anagrams in 17th century scientific writing to safeguard inventions and discoveries, thus allowing them to prove discovery priority?

---

> When Robert Hooke discovered his law of elasticity in 1676, he didn’t publish it in the ordinary way. Instead, he published it as an anagram: “ceiiinosssttuv.” He revealed this two years later as the Latin ut tensio, sic vis, meaning “as the extension, so the force.” This ensured that if someone else made the same discovery, Hooke could reveal the anagram and claim priority, thus buying time in which he alone could build upon the discovery.

> Many great scientists of the age, including Leonardo, Galileo and Huygens, used anagrams or ciphers for similar purposes.

> The use of ciphers became a fairly standard way of documenting discoveries before their actual publication. This is illustrated for instance in the proceedings of the Royal Society meeting from February 4, 1668. Here, a letter by Christiaan Huygens is discussed in which Huygens explicitly proposes:

> a way of securing his discoveries and inventions for the future by way of cypher or anagram, to be lodged in the Register-book of the society, till he should think it convenient to explain them in a common language; making withal a beginning of this way of communicating new discoveries by sending the following cypher; which was ordered to be entered into the Register-book.
